title: Proposal
---
##Summary:
We will be creating a machine learning agent that will learn to fight. Our learning agent will use the pixels that our agent sees as input. Then we will put it into a computer vision leaning algorithm. The ouput will be the mouse clicks/moves it makes.

##AI/ML Algorithms:
We will be using a computer vision object recognition algorithm to detect the enviroment. We will also use a reinforcement learning algorithm to teach our agent how fight.

##Evaluation Plan:
We will make the agent fight past iterations of itself taking time into account and confirm that it is improving. Not sure if we are going to use a nuero dynamic programming based algorithm or not. Our moonshot will be if the agent can beat our team.
